# MockProtect-ISMS

Welcome to the **MockProtect-ISMS** repository ‚Äî a comprehensive implementation of an **Information Security Management System (ISMS)** based on the **ISO/IEC 27001:2022** standard. This project is built around a fictional organization, **MockProtect GmbH**, to demonstrate practical ISMS documentation, planning, and implementation workflows.

The project covers essential components such as:
- Policy development
- Risk assessment planning
- Gap assessments
- Awareness and training procedures
- Internal monitoring and audit preparation
- Management review and continual improvement framework

It is intended to help learners, practitioners, and auditors understand how a real-world ISMS implementation might be structured, documented, and managed.
