## 3. Areas of Concern & Root Cause

| Issue                    | Root Cause                          | Mitigation Plan                                   |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| High Phishing Test Failures | Lack of awareness in 2 new departments | Refresher training & simulated campaigns          |
| Delayed Document Reviews | Resource constraints in documentation | Assign deputy reviewers, revise deadlines         |
| Informal Change Implementations | Emergency fixes bypassed CAB process | Reiterate policy, implement CAB tracking          |
| Compliance Events (x2)  | Vendor failed to comply with SLA   | Reassess SLA terms and add compliance clause      |

---

## 4. Trends and Observations
- **Positive:** Incident response and backup procedures continue to perform reliably.  
- **Negative:** Recurring delays in document review cycles indicate the need for improved documentation ownership.

---

## 5. Recommendations
- Schedule additional phishing awareness sessions before Q3 begins.
- Perform a mini-audit of the documentation process to identify bottlenecks.
- Include emergency change approvals in Change Management SOP training.
- Review vendor compliance protocols and monitoring practices.
