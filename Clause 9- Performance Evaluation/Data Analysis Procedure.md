## 1. Purpose
The purpose of this procedure is to define a consistent and effective approach to analyzing ISMS-related data within MockProtect. It supports informed decision-making, performance monitoring, compliance assessment, and continual improvement of the Information Security Management System.

---

## 2. Scope
This procedure applies to all ISMS data collected through monitoring, measurements, audits, incident management, user access reviews, and other controls as required by ISO/IEC 27001. It includes both qualitative and quantitative data analysis relevant to information security.

## 3. Responsibilities

| Role               | Responsibility                                                            |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CISO               | Ensure the implementation of this procedure and review of data trends.   |
| Process Owners     | Submit relevant performance data for analysis.                           |
| ISMS Coordinator   | Coordinate data collection, standardize analysis methods, and maintain reports. |
| Internal Audit Team| Provide audit results and assist in data interpretation.                 |
| Risk Officer       | Integrate analysis with risk assessments and treatment decisions.        |

## 4. Types of Data Analyzed
- Security Incidents and Events (e.g., failed login attempts, malware detection)
- Access Control Logs
- Training and Awareness Records
- Audit Findings (Internal/External)
- Compliance Reports
- System Performance Metrics (availability, uptime)
- Backup and Recovery Logs
- Change Management Records
- Supplier Performance Data
- Risk Treatment Status
- Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Metrics

---

## 5. Data Analysis Process

### Step 1: Data Collection
- Data is gathered from multiple ISMS processes according to their measurement plans.
- Collected in predefined formats (spreadsheets, reports, dashboards).
- Sources include:
  - Security tools (SIEM, antivirus)
  - Helpdesk/ticketing systems
  - Audit and compliance systems
  - Training records

### Step 2: Data Verification
- All data must be validated for accuracy, completeness, and timeliness.
- Verification involves cross-checking logs, reports, and automated metrics.
- Any anomalies must be flagged and investigated.

### Step 3: Categorization
- Data is categorized by:
  - Process (e.g., access control, incident response)
  - Type (e.g., metric, KPI, observation)
  - Severity (e.g., low, medium, high)

### Step 4: Analysis Techniques

| Type of Data          | Analysis Method                                              |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Quantitative (e.g., KPIs) | Trend analysis, statistical modelling, thresholds, comparative analysis |
| Qualitative (e.g., audit findings) | Root cause analysis, thematic categorization, correlation |
| Security Events      | Pattern recognition, incident frequency, impact and root cause |
| Risk Data            | Risk scoring comparisons, heat maps, mitigation effectiveness |

**Tools used:** Excel, Power BI, SIEM dashboards, Risk Register software

### Step 5: Trend and Pattern Identification
- Identify trends over time (e.g., increase in incidents).
- Compare performance across departments or quarters.
- Highlight recurring issues or control weaknesses.

### Step 6: Reporting
- Analysis results are compiled in quarterly and annual ISMS reports.
- Executive summaries are created for top management.
- Recommendations for action or improvement are documented.

### Step 7: Integration with Decision-Making
- Data informs:
  - Risk reassessments
  - Changes in controls
  - Management reviews
  - Policy updates
  - Training programs

---

## 6. Tools & Systems Used
- **SIEM Systems:** For real-time event data and anomaly detection.
- **GRC Tools:** For compliance, risk tracking, and reporting.
- **Spreadsheets / Dashboards:** For KPI tracking and performance visualization.
- **Audit Management Software:** For linking findings to corrective actions.

---

## 7. Data Retention
- Analysis data is retained for a minimum of 3 years for audit and compliance purposes.
- Stored in secure document repositories with restricted access.

---

## 8. Review and Continuous Improvement
- This procedure is reviewed annually or after a significant change in ISMS processes or regulatory requirements.
- Improvement opportunities identified from analysis results are captured in the Continual Improvement Register.
- All improvements are tracked and reported during Management Reviews.
