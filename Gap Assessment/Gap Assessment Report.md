## 1. Introduction

### Purpose of Gap Assessment

The purpose of this gap assessment is to evaluate MockProtect's current compliance with ISO/IEC 27001:2022 standard requirements. The gap assessment identifies areas where the organisation meets the standard and highlights the gaps that need to be addressed to achieve full compliance and prepare for certification.

### Scope of the Assessment

#### Organizational Scope

## 6. Recommendations

### High-Priority Recommendations (Critical to ISMS Foundation)

1. **Establish and Document a Risk Assessment & Treatment Methodology**
   - Reason: Clause 6.1 is foundational for ISMS planning and control selection.
   - Action: Define methodology, risk register, risk criteria, and treatment plans.

2. **Develop and Finalize the ISMS Scope (Clause 4.3)**
   - Reason: Essential for ISMS boundaries and audit readiness.
   - Action: Include exclusions, locations, assets, and justification.

3. **Define and Approve the Information Security Policy (Clause 5.2)**
   - Reason: Sets the direction and commitment of leadership.
   - Action: Review, approve, and communicate the final policy.

4. **Implement Documented ISMS Processes and Interlinkages (Clause 4.4)**
   - Reason: Provides a clear structure for implementation or audit.
   - Action: Create an ISMS Manual and define process interactions.

5. **Initiate a Structured Internal Audit Program (Clause 9.2)**
   - Reason: Measures ISMS performance and identifies nonconformities.
   - Action: Define audit scope, frequency, criteria, and maintain records.

6. **Define and Implement Monitoring & Measurement (Clause 9.1)**
   - Reason: KPIs and metrics evaluate ISMS effectiveness.
   - Action: Set measurable indicators and review periodically.

7. **Develop a Nonconformity and Corrective Action Process (Clause 10.1)**
   - Reason: Addresses ISMS failures and prevents recurrence.
   - Action: Log incidents, investigate causes, and document actions taken.

8. **Build a Formal Security Awareness and Training Program (Clause 7.3)**
   - Reason: Reduces human error and embeds a security culture.
   - Action: Role-based training, onboarding security education, recurring awareness campaigns.

9. **Conduct Management Reviews on a Scheduled Basis (Clause 9.3)**
   - Reason: Ensures top management oversight and continual improvement.
   - Action: Schedule quarterly reviews, capture decisions and actions.

10. **Implement a Centralized Document Management System (Clause 7.5)**
    - Reason: Required for version control, traceability, and audit readiness.
    - Action: Use a DMS tool to manage ISMS documentation lifecycle.

These actions should be addressed in the initial phase of ISMS implementation, ideally within the first 3–4 months, to establish a strong and auditable foundation.

## 7. Conclusion

The Gap Assessment has identified areas where MockProtect should focus efforts to achieve compliance with ISO 27001:2022. By prioritising the development of foundational elements such as information security policy, risk assessment, and ISMS scope, the organisation can build a strong base for its ISMS. Implementing the recommended actions will position the organisation for successful certification and enhance its overall information security posture.
