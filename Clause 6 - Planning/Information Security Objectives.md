## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this Information Security Objectives document is to define and formalize specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) objectives that support the strategic information security goals of MockProtect.

These objectives are designed to:

- Ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information assets.
- Support continual improvement of the Information Security Management System (ISMS).
- Facilitate compliance with ISO/IEC 27001:2022, legal, regulatory, and contractual obligations.
- Mitigate information security risks through proactive and structured initiatives.
- Align security priorities with MockProtect’s business strategy and risk appetite.

This document also serves as a key input to the management review process and enables ongoing evaluation of ISMS effectiveness.

## 2. Scope

This document applies to:

- All business units, departments, and operational teams within MockProtect.
- All personnel (employees, contractors, third parties) who have access to information assets managed or owned by MockProtect.
- All systems, networks, applications, and data processed, stored, or transmitted by MockProtect, including cloud-based and on-premises infrastructure.
- All locations where MockProtect conducts business operations, including remote work environments.

The objectives outlined herein apply to the 2025–2026 ISMS cycle and will be reviewed at least annually, or upon significant changes in the business, risk landscape, or regulatory environment.

## 6. Monitoring and Review

- **Defined Metrics:** Each SMART objective is assigned measurable KPIs (e.g., % of vulnerabilities remediated, audit closure rate).
- **Automated Tracking:** MockProtect will use security tools (e.g., SIEM, vulnerability scanners, GRC platforms) to collect and visualize data automatically.
- **Monthly Reporting:** Department leads will submit objective progress updates monthly to the ISMS Manager.
- **Quarterly Reviews:** ISMS Steering Committee will conduct quarterly performance reviews and track risk treatment progress.
- **Management Review:** A formal Management Review will be conducted bi-annually to assess the effectiveness of the ISMS and recommend updates.

## 7. Communication of Objectives

- **Kick-off Meetings:** Security objectives will be communicated during annual security briefings and project kick-offs.
- **Awareness Campaigns:** Objectives and progress will be shared via internal newsletters, Slack, and posters (especially security awareness, remote access).
- **Departmental Briefings:** Department heads will communicate role-specific objectives during team meetings.
- **Training Integration:** Objectives (e.g., phishing simulations, access control) are embedded into mandatory security training.
- **Performance Reviews:** Objectives tied to individual/team KPIs will be referenced during employee performance evaluations.

## 8. Document Control

- **Central Repository:** All ISMS documents will be stored in a secure, version-controlled document management system (e.g., Confluence, SharePoint, or a GRC tool).
- **Versioning:** Each document will include a version history, approval log, and change summary.
- **Access Controls:** Only authorized personnel (e.g., ISMS Manager, Policy Owners) can modify documents. Read access is granted based on roles.
- **Review Cycle:** Documents will be reviewed annually or upon significant changes (e.g., after an incident or audit).
- **Change Control:** Updates to critical documents will follow a documented change management process, with mandatory approvals.
