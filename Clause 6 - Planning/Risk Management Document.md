## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this document is to define the methodology and process that MockProtect will use to identify, assess, and treat information security risks in accordance with ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clause 6.1. This ensures risk-based thinking is embedded into the Information Security Management System (ISMS).

## 2. Scope

This risk management process applies to all assets, personnel, systems, and services within the ISMS scope of MockProtect, including products like the SIEM Integration Module, SOAR Orchestration Engine, and Analytics Dashboard.

## 3. Risk Assessment Methodology

### 3.1 Objectives
- Identify risks that may impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information assets.
- Evaluate the impact and likelihood of those risks.
- Prioritize risks to support effective treatment and resource allocation.

### 3.2 Risk Identification
Risks are identified through:
- Asset inventory review
- Threat modeling workshops
- Incident history analysis
- Regulatory gap assessments
- Internal interviews  

Identified risks must be associated with specific information assets and threat scenarios.

### 3.3 Risk Analysis Criteria

#### Likelihood

| Rating | Likelihood      | Description                        |
|--------|-----------------|------------------------------------|
| 1      | Rare            | May occur only in exceptional circumstances |
| 2      | Unlikely        | Could happen, but not expected    |
| 3      | Possible        | Might occur at some point         |
| 4      | Likely          | Expected to occur in most cases   |
| 5      | Almost Certain  | Expected to occur frequently or in most circumstances |

#### Impact

| Rating | Impact Level | Description                                           |
|--------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Insignificant | Minimal impact, no data loss, negligible disruption   |
| 2      | Minor         | Minor disruption or small data breach with limited consequences |
| 3      | Moderate      | Noticeable impact on operations or moderate data breach |
| 4      | Major         | Significant impact, customer data compromised, regulatory attention |
| 5      | Critical      | Severe operational failure, legal penalties, or reputational damage |

### 3.3.1 Risk Analysis Heat Map

| Impact ↓ / Likelihood → | 1 (Rare) | 2 (Unlikely) | 3 (Possible) | 4 (Likely) | 5 (Almost Certain) |
|-------------------------|----------|--------------|--------------|------------|--------------------|
| 1 (Insignificant)       | 1 Very Low | 2 Very Low   | 3 Low        | 4 Low      | 5 Medium           |
| 2 (Minor)               | 2 Very Low | 4 Low        | 6 Medium     | 8 Medium   | 10 High            |
| 3 (Moderate)            | 3 Low      | 6 Medium     | 9 Medium     | 12 High    | 15 High            |
| 4 (Major)               | 4 Low      | 8 Medium     | 12 High      | 16 Very High | 20 Very High      |
| 5 (Critical)            | 5 Medium   | 10 High      | 15 High      | 20 Very High | 25 Very High      |

### 3.4 Risk Evaluation

Risk Score = Likelihood × Impact (both rated 1–5)

| Risk Score Range | Risk Level | Action Required |
|------------------|------------|-----------------|
| 1–2              | Very Low   | Minimal risk. Monitor during regular reviews. |
| 3–4              | Low        | Acceptable risk. Monitor periodically. |
| 5–9              | Medium     | Requires management attention. Plan mitigation or accept with rationale. |
| 10–15            | High       | Action required. Mitigation plan must be developed and monitored. |
| 16–25            | Very High  | Unacceptable. Immediate action required. |

### 3.5 Risk Acceptance Criteria

Risks above the defined risk acceptance threshold (score ≥ 5) must be treated unless top management accepts the risk.

### 3.6 Risk Acceptance Thresholds

| Risk Level  | Score Range | Acceptance Criteria |
|-------------|-------------|---------------------|
| Very Low    | 1–2         | Acceptable. No action needed. Monitor as part of routine oversight. |
| Low         | 3–4         | Acceptable. Monitor and review periodically. |
| Medium      | 5–9         | Conditionally acceptable. May be accepted with documented justification by CISO/CTO. |
| High        | 10–14       | Not acceptable without a formal risk treatment plan. Must be mitigated or reduced. |
| Very High   | 15–25       | Unacceptable. Requires immediate treatment or must be avoided or transferred. |

### 3.7 Approval Process for Risk Acceptance

- Low Risks: Accepted by ISMS Team Lead.
- Medium Risks: Reviewed and approved by CISO with justification.
- High & Very High Risks:
  - Formal risk treatment plan required.
  - Approval from Top Management (CEO, CISO, CTO).
  - Ongoing tracking and reporting to ISMS Steering Committee.

## 4. Risk Treatment Process

### 4.1 Treatment Options

- **Avoidance**: Eliminate the source of the risk.
- **Mitigation**: Apply controls to reduce likelihood or impact.
- **Transfer**: Outsource risk through contracts or insurance.
- **Acceptance**: Acknowledge the risk if within tolerance.

### 4.2 Risk Treatment Plan

Includes:
- Selected control(s) (aligned to ISO 27001 Annex A)
- Responsible owner
- Target implementation date
- Residual risk rating  

Treatment plans are tracked and reviewed quarterly.

## 5. Documentation and Records

- **Risk Register**: Record of identified risks, assessments, treatments, and status.
- **Statement of Applicability (SoA)**: Links Annex A controls to risk treatment decisions and justification for exclusions.
- **Risk Assessment Report**: Generated after each risk assessment and shared with top management.

## 6. Review and Continuous Improvement

- The process is reviewed annually or upon significant changes.
- Emerging threats and incidents trigger unscheduled reassessments.

## 7. Roles and Responsibilities

- **CISO**: Oversees risk management process.
- **ISMS Manager**: Facilitates assessments, maintains risk register, monitors treatments.
- **Department Heads**: Provide input on domain-specific risks and support mitigation.
- **All Employees**: Report potential risks and follow controls.

## 8. Risk Register and Treatment Template

The Risk Register will also be used as a Risk Assessment template.
