## Subject: Approval of the Statement of Applicability (SoA) and Authorization to Implement the Information Security Management System (ISMS)

Dear Team,

We are pleased to inform you that the Top Management of MockProtect has formally reviewed and approved the Statement of Applicability (SoA) developed in alignment with the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001:2022.

The SoA provides a comprehensive summary of the information security controls that have been assessed for applicability to MockProtectâ€™s context, based on our business needs, risk environment, legal and regulatory obligations, and stakeholder expectations. These controls have been evaluated against Annex A of ISO/IEC 27001:2022, and both applicable and non-applicable controls have been documented with justifications.

In line with this, Top Management grants full authorization to proceed with the implementation of the Information Security Management System (ISMS), as scoped and planned under the guidance of our ISMS Steering Committee and Information Security Officer (ISO).

The objectives of the ISMS implementation include:

- Protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information assets.
- Complying with regulatory, contractual, and statutory obligations.
- Minimizing the impact of information security risks to an acceptable level.
- Supporting continual improvement in information security management practices.

We expect all departments and teams to actively support this initiative by:

- Adhering to the approved controls listed in the SoA.
- Complying with the newly established and updated information security policies.
- Participating in awareness sessions, training programs, and audits.
- Reporting any incidents or concerns related to information security promptly.

The ISMS initiative is a strategic priority for MockProtect and is critical in reinforcing our position as a trusted and secure technology provider. Your commitment and cooperation are essential to ensure its successful deployment and maintenance.

If you have any questions or require further clarification, please contact the Information Security Team or ISMS Program Lead.

Thank you for your continued support.

Sincerely,  
<br>
