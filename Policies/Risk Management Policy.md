## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this Risk Management Policy is to define the principles and requirements for identifying, assessing, treating, and monitoring information security risks across MockProtect. This policy ensures alignment with ISO/IEC 27001:2022 and supports the protection of MockProtect’s critical assets and services.

---

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to:  
- All information assets managed by MockProtect, whether hosted on-premises or in the cloud.  
- All employees, contractors, and third-party service providers who access or manage MockProtect’s systems and data.  
- All platforms, including the MockProtect Mobile App, SIEM Integration Module, EDR Integration Service, SOAR Orchestration Engine, and Analytics Dashboard.  
- All data types handled by MockProtect, including personal data, security incident metadata, analytics, and client configurations.

## 3. Policy Statement

- All information security risks must be identified, assessed, and managed in a structured and consistent manner throughout MockProtect.
- Risk assessments shall be conducted at least twice per year, and in response to significant changes such as:
  - Introduction of new systems, processes, or vendors
  - Changes in legal or regulatory requirements
  - Security incidents or emerging threats
- Identified risks shall be documented in the official Risk Register with associated:
  - Risk description
  - Impact and likelihood scores
  - Risk owner
  - Applicable controls
  - Treatment status
- Risk owners must be assigned for each identified risk and are responsible for ensuring risk treatment actions are implemented effectively and on time.
- Risks assessed as "High" or unacceptable must be treated with appropriate controls or mitigation strategies to reduce them to an acceptable level (typically "Medium" or lower).
- All treatments and controls must be documented in a formal Risk Treatment Plan and reviewed by the ISMS team.
- The effectiveness of implemented controls shall be verified through internal audits, testing, and monitoring activities.
- The Risk Register must be reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis, or more frequently if new risks emerge or treatment plans are completed.
- This policy must be communicated to all relevant stakeholders, and all personnel must be aware of their roles in risk identification and reporting.
