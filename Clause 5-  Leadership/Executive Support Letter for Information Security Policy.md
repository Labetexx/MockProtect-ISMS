# LTR-002 Executive Statement of Commitment to Information Security

At MockProtect, our mission is to deliver trusted cybersecurity solutions that protect the digital assets of our clients and their end-users. In alignment with this mission, and in accordance with the ISO/IEC 27001:2022 standard, we formally endorse the organization’s Information Security Policy as a foundational component of our Information Security Management System (ISMS).

We, the executive leadership of MockProtect, fully recognize the importance of information security in enabling business resilience, maintaining regulatory compliance, and ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information assets across our operations, products, and services — including our SIEM, EDR, SOAR, and analytics platforms.

This policy reflects our unwavering commitment to:

- Protecting client and company data from threats, whether internal or external, deliberate or accidental.
- Complying with all applicable legal, regulatory, and contractual obligations including the GDPR, UK GDPR, NIS2 Directive, BDSG, and TTDSG.
- Establishing and reviewing measurable information security objectives aligned with business needs.
- Providing the necessary resources and support to implement and continually improve the ISMS.
- Promoting a security-aware culture across all departments and levels of the organization.
- Enabling risk-based decision-making to address evolving cybersecurity threats and challenges.

The Information Security Policy shall be communicated to all employees, contractors, and relevant third parties, and will be reviewed annually or upon significant changes to our business, regulatory obligations, or threat landscape.

We encourage all staff to take ownership of their information security responsibilities and support the continued maturity and effectiveness of the ISMS.

Together, we ensure that security is not just a requirement — it is our shared responsibility.
